# Data Collection Protocol for Keyboard-only Biometrics

1. Each user types a fixed passphrase 3 times per session.
2. Each user does 60 seconds of free typing (random text copy).
3. Collect 5-10 sessions per user across different times/days.
4. Record keydown & keyup timestamps for each key press.
5. Store only timing data (no actual typed text).
